The Framework processes for my of the behaviour of the classes in the SCJ API. The Circus folder contains the *Circus* version of the model. The CSP version is in the CSP folder. The *Circus* version is what I use to fully capture the paradigm of SCJ Level 2, while the CSP version exists as a translation of the *Circus* version to allow us to model check our specifcaitons using FDR3.

The models in this project are compatible with the draft version of the SCJ language specification version 0.96, published on the 9th of October 2014.
