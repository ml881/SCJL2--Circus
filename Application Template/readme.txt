Templates for the Application Processes of my *Circus* model of SCJ Level 2. The Application Processes capture the program-specific behaviour of the classes extending the API classes. For example, the schedulables regsitered in the `initialize()` method of the class `MyMission`, which extends the `Mission` API class.
