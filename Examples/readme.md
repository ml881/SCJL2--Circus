-------------------------------------

Examples of SCJ Level 2 Programs in my SCJ Level2 *Circus* model. Each directory contains a different simple example program, and the *Circus* model and CSP model for each program. Each program has a small object diagram showing its structure. The programs should be compiled using the versio of icecapSDK included in the Examples directory.
